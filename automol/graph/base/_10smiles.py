Protocol for encoding resonance single bond stereo into the SMILES string:

    Resonance single bond stereo is specified exactly the same way as double
    bond stereo, using directional bonds on either side of the bond. It isn't
    pretty, but the code is very simple.

    To turn the resonance stereo SMILES into a standard SMILES that is
    interpretable by regular programs, one can simply delete the
    directionality from all double bonds in the string. This may leave some
    extra directional single bonds, but they won't affect anything.
