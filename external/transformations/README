# transformations

calculate homogeneous transformation matrices for translating, rotating,
reflecting, scaling, shearing, projecting, orthogonalizing, and superimposing
3D homogeneous coordinates, convert between rotation matrices, Euler angles,
and quaternions, decompose transformation matrices, and provide an Arcball
control object.
