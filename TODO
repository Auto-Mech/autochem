(A) Implement physical consistency check to see if a given set of reactants and
products are compatible with a given TS.

Maybe this can be done as follows:
(a) Sort reactants/products graphs to match TS atom ordering
(b) Convert them to local stereo
(c) Generates reactants/products graph directly from the TS
(d) Convert *those* (from (c)) to local stereo
(e) Compare the graphs from (b) to those from (c)
