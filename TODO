    [X] Make automol.graph.geometry take TS graphs
    [X] Add TS AMChIs:
        [X] /k layer breaking bonds
        [X] /f* layer forming bonds

    [ ] Figure out why test_graph.py/test__smiles() is failing
    [ ] Include zmatrix data in Reaction string

    [ ] Move non-reac related files in automol/reac/ into automol/misc/
        New structure:
            TS keys are independent from reactants and products keys
            The *order* of the keys in rxn.reactants_keys indicates the mapping
            onto reactants keys, and likewise for rxn.products_keys.
            This means we no longer have to store a mapping, and should lend
            itself to the next step of adding structures to the object for
            tracking how they map onto each other.
