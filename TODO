[X] Remove map from Reaction object
[X] Refactor Reaction finders to take graphs with *standard keys*
[ ] UPDATE AGAINST CHANGE TO Reaction OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    [X] _2stereo.py
    [X] _3find.py
    [X] Implement Reaction object structure addition
    [X] Stereo-correct join for atom stereo
    [X] Stereo-correct join for bond stereo
    LEFT OFF AT automol.geom.ts.geometry_from_reactants() clean_geometry step
    -> SEE test_ts_geometry.ipynb
        [X] Test this function to see if it covers all cases!!!
        [X] Fix breaking test case!!
    [X] Figure out and TEST reagent reordering
    [X] _4geom.py
    [X] Make automol.graph.geometry take TS graphs
    [X] Add TS AMChIs:
        [X] /k layer breaking bonds
        [X] /f* layer forming bonds
        [X] /r* layer for direction reversal (/r1 = reversed)
    [X] Finish removing autoparse dependency:
        [X] inchi_key.py
        [X] geom/_conv.py
        [X] geom/_pyx2z.py
    [X] Figure out why test_graph.py/test__smiles() is failing
    [X] Implement dummy transformation tables
        [X] See failing tests due to zmatrix_with_conversion_info() =>
        zmatrix_with_dummy_transformation()
        [X] Replace relabel_for_zmatrix() functions with apply_dummy_transformation() functions
        [X] Replace relabel_for_geometry() functions with reverse_dummy_transformation() functions
        [X] Both of the above will take the same `dc_` data structure, returned from zmatrix_with_conversion_info()
    [ ] _5zmat.py
        Strategy:
            [X] If forming bond is linear, add a dummy atom (currently only sigma abstractions -- use reacting_electron_direction)
            [X] Forming rings:
                [X] If there is a breaking bond in the ring, exclude it
                [X] If there are multiple breaking/forming bonds, split on a breaking bond to put the forming bonds as close as possible to the end (this minimizes coordinate dependencies on the forming bonds)
            [ ] Bimoleculars: Start from "reagent 1"
                [ ] For atom transfers, this is the atom donor (the reagent that contains a breaking bond)
                [ ] For additions, this is the larger reagent, as measured by (heavy atoms, total atoms, electrons)

    [ ] Move non-reac related files in automol/reac/ into automol/misc/
        New structure:
            TS keys are independent from reactants and products keys
            The *order* of the keys in rxn.reactants_keys indicates the mapping
            onto reactants keys, and likewise for rxn.products_keys.
            This means we no longer have to store a mapping, and should lend
            itself to the next step of adding structures to the object for
            tracking how they map onto each other.
