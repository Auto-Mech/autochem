o Test conversion to/from local stereo
o Test reflection
o Test enantiomer detection

In graph/base/_stereo.py
o Deprecate local_atom/bond_stereo_from_... with equivalent functions in
  graph/base/_geom.py?
o Implement expand_stereo for TS graphs
o Implement stereo_corrected_geometry for TS graphs

In graph/base/_rot.py
o Figure out if something needs to be implemented for TS graphs here??
