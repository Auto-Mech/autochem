    [X] Implement Reaction object structure addition

    [X] Stereo-correct join for bond stereo
    LEFT OFF AT automol.geom.ts.geometry_from_reactants() clean_geometry step
    -> SEE test_ts_geometry.ipynb
        [X] Test this function to see if it covers all cases!!!
        [X] Fix breaking test case!!
    [X] Figure out and TEST reagent reordering
    [X] _4geom.py
    [X] Make automol.graph.geometry take TS graphs
    [X] Add TS AMChIs:
        [X] /k layer breaking bonds
        [X] /f* layer forming bonds
        [X] /r* layer for direction reversal (/r1 = reversed)
    [X] Finish removing autoparse dependency:
        [X] inchi_key.py
        [X] geom/_conv.py
        [X] geom/_pyx2z.py
    [X] Figure out why test_graph.py/test__smiles() is failing
    [X] Implement dummy transformation tables
        [X] See failing tests due to zmatrix_with_conversion_info() =>
        zmatrix_with_dummy_transformation()
        [X] Replace relabel_for_zmatrix() functions with apply_dummy_transformation() functions
        [X] Replace relabel_for_geometry() functions with reverse_dummy_transformation() functions
        [X] Both of the above will take the same `dc_` data structure, returned from zmatrix_with_conversion_info()
    [x] _5zmat.py
        Strategy:
            [X] If forming bond is linear, add a dummy atom (currently only sigma abstractions -- use reacting_electron_direction)
            [X] Forming rings:
                [X] If there is a breaking bond in the ring, exclude it
                [X] If there are multiple breaking/forming bonds, split on a breaking bond to put the forming bonds as close as possible to the end (this minimizes coordinate dependencies on the forming bonds)
            [X] Bimoleculars: Start from "reagent 1"
                [X] For atom transfers, this is the atom donor (the reagent that contains a breaking bond)
                [X] For additions, this is the larger reagent, as measured by (heavy atoms, total atoms, electrons)
            [X] FIX BROKEN SN2 case: test_reac/test__end_to_end() line 292
            [X] FIX BROKEN insertion case: test_reac/test__end_to_end() line 349
    [X] FIX BROKEN geometry generation (run test_graph.py tests)
            [X] Implement direct graph => RDKit molecule conversion with stereo
            [X] Finish debugging that -- see test_convert.py
            [X] Implement direct RDKit molecule => graph conversion with stereo
            [X] Debug that
            [X] Rewrite the geometry conversion algorithm using direct graph conversion (preserves atom ordering, preventing the need for isomorphism checks)
            [X] FAILED automol/tests/test_convert.py::test__symmetry_removal - assert not frozenset({(0, 1, 2, 5)})
            [X] FAILED automol/tests/test_reac.py::test__end_to_end - TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
    [X] Remove reagent reordering -- just use the initial input order
    [X] Implement interconversion of Reaction obj with structures
            [X] implement with_geom_structures
            [X] Geometry => z-matrix
            [X] Testing
            [X] Z-matrix => geometry
            [X] Work out dummy atom handling -- need to figure out how to account for TS dummy atoms that are not present in the reagent when shifting keys to line things up
            [X] Testing
            [X] implement with_zmat_structures (under the hood, calls add_geom_structures and then converts)
                [X] We can allow this to take pre-existing rct/prd zmas as input, as long as the user also passes in a dummy conversion relative to the original geo (matching the original Reaction object keys). 
            [X] implement with_structures(rxn, typ)
    [ ] Test Reaction structure addition/interconversion
            [X] Implement graph.geometry_matches to check if a geometry matches a graph (including TS graphs/geometries) -- for forming bond keys, it can check that the attaching atom is the closest non-bonded atom (possibly except for 2nd degree neighbors?)
            [ ] For each case in test__end_to_end(), check that each TS/R/P geometry matches the corresponding graph
    [ ] Update existing Reac functions to properly handle structures
        [ ] 
    [ ] _6scan.py
    [ ] _7rot.py
    [ ] _8conv.py
    [ ] Move non-reac related files in automol/reac/ into automol/misc/
        New structure:
            TS keys are independent from reactants and products keys
            The *order* of the keys in rxn.reactants_keys indicates the mapping
            onto reactants keys, and likewise for rxn.products_keys.
            This means we no longer have to store a mapping, and should lend
            itself to the next step of adding structures to the object for
            tracking how they map onto each other.
