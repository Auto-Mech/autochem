        New structure:
            TS keys are independent from reactants and products keys
            The *order* of the keys in rxn.reactants_keys indicates the mapping
            onto reactants keys, and likewise for rxn.products_keys.
            This means we no longer have to store a mapping, and should lend
            itself to the next step of adding structures to the object for
            tracking how they map onto each other.
